# SkyBoundAI

**SkyBoundAI** is a personal autonomous drone project that combines AI with flight control and obstacle avoidance to enable fully intelligent, real-time aerial navigation.

# Simple Beginner-Friendly Autonomous Drone Project with Tello

Below is a **very simple** beginner-friendly roadmap for an autonomous (or semi-autonomous) drone project. We’ll use the **Ryze Tello** because it’s inexpensive, easy to program, and widely used in educational settings. The idea is to build a foundation you can expand later—such as adding computer vision, obstacle avoidance, or more advanced autonomy.

## 1. Gather Basic Tools and Materials

1. **Drone**  
   - **Ryze Tello** (preferred for beginners due to its simplicity and official Python SDK).  

2. **Laptop/PC**  
   - You’ll use this for coding, connecting to the drone over Wi-Fi, and running simple scripts.

3. **Software**  
   - **Python 3** installed.  
   - **Tello SDK / Tello Python library** (community libraries exist on GitHub).  
   - A simple code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code).

4. **Environment**  
   - An open, indoor area free of obstacles (living room, gym, or yard on a calm day).

## 2. Set Up the Drone

1. **Charge the Tello Battery**  
   - Make sure you have enough battery life for test flights.

2. **Connect the Tello to Your Laptop**  
   - Turn on the drone; it creates a Wi-Fi hotspot called something like “TELLO-XXXXXX.”  
   - Connect your computer to that Wi-Fi network.

3. **Install Tello SDK or Python Wrapper**  
   - There are official and unofficial Python libraries for Tello.

## 3. Write a Basic “Takeoff & Land” Script

   - Check out test_drone.py in my repo.

## 4. Capture a Video Stream

   - Capture a Video Stream (PENDING)
